## Regular Expressions usually "regex" or "regexp" are patterns that helps in find, match and replace text in a string. Are very powerful, but can be easily confunsig.

```JavaScript
/**
 * Regular Expressions are powerfull matching tools, usually written betweeen slashes, like /regex/
 * They are patterns used to find and replace text in a string.
 * The test method is used to test if a string matches a regular expression, is used regex.test(string) and return a boolean.
 * Is possible to use the alternation operator | in the regex to look for multiple alternatives.
 * Afther the slash in the regex is possible to use modifiers, the first is i to ignore case.
 * the match method is used to find the first match of a regular expression in a string, is used regex.match(string) and return an array with the match or null if not found.
 * Another modifier is g to match all, instead of stopping at the first match will search for all matches.
 * The wildcard, dot or period is a char used in the regex when is unknown all the characters wanted, so it can be used to match any pattern

const str = "Hello World";

const regex = /Hello/;
const test = regex.test(str);       // true

const regexOr = /Hello|Jello/;
const test = regexOr.test(str);     // true

const regexI = /HELLO/i;
const test = regexI.test(str);      // true, without the i modifier it would be false

const match = str.match(regex);     // ["Hello"]

const regexG = /repeat/gi;          // g global, i ignore case
const str = "REPEAT in uppercase, repeat in lowercase, RepeAt, Repeat"
const match = str.match(regexG);   // ["Repeat", "Repeat", "Repeat", "Repeat"]

const str = "run in the sun to have some fun and make some pun with nun and bun"
const regex = /.un/gi;
const match = str.match(regex);    // ["run", "fun", "pun", "nun", "bun"]

/**
 * Until now we only have saw literal patterns, but it's possible to be more flexible.
 * Using character classes, we can match any character in the class, definig then insine square brackets.
 * Is possible to match ranges too, like [a-z] or [0-9] or [^a-z] or [^0-9], the ^ is used to negate the class (negated character sets).
 * And combine ranges, like all alphanumeric characters are found by /[a-z0-9]/
 * The + modifier is used to match characters which occur one or more times in a row. And is used without the brackets.
 * The * modifier is used to match characters which occur zero or more times in a row. And is used without the brackets.

/**
 * A greedy regex is a regex that will match the longest possible string. The alternative is a lazy regex, which will match the shortest possible string.
 * The greedy regex is used like /t[a-z]*i/ applied in "titanic" would return "titani", and the lazy regex write as /t[a-z]*?i/ would return "ti".
 * it's not recommend to parsing html with regex, but to match a string in the html with regex is fine.

/**
 * The negate operator (caret character) inside characters set will negate all characters except the ones in the set,

/**
 * shorthand character classes are shortcuts to common character sets,
 * like \w is for all alphanumeric characters ([a-zA-Z0-9_]), \d for all digits ([0-9]), \s for all whitespace characters.
 * \s is the equivalent of [\r\t\v\n\f]. In the case of \w it has one more character besides the alphanumeric characters, the underscore.
 * And you can access the negated versions of the shorthands by using the same letter but in Capital, like the negation of \w is \W.
 * Beside + and *, you can match a certain range of patterns, so is possible to specify the range using curly brackets after the pattern.
 * For example, the regex /[a-z]{2,4}/ will match all strings with at least two characters and at most four characters.
 * And still possible to define only the minimum number of characters, so the regex /[a-z]{2,}/ will match all strings with at least two characters.
 * And if you want a specific number of characters, is just need to use the curly brackter without the comma and the exact number of characters.
 * For example, the regex /[a-z]{2}/ will match all strings with exactly two characters.
 */

const regex = /[a-z]{2,4}/g; // will match all strings with at least two characters and at most four characters
const regex = /[a-z]{6,}/g;  // will match all strings with at least six characters
const regex = /[a-z]{12}/g;   // will match all strings with exactly twelve characters

/**
 * Some languages although being "the same" have little differences in their syntax,
 * like American English and British English or Brazilian Portuguese and Portugal Portuguese.
 * So is possible sometimes a character exists or not in the pattern given the language. Then to verify if a character exists in a pattern,
 * you can use the question mark (?) character to match the pattern even the character doesn't exist in the string.
 * lookaheads are patterns to match multiple patterns over the same string, the lookaheads can be positive or negative.
 * A positive (?=) lookahead is used to test if the patterm is present in the string and return the matching string.
 * A negative (?!) lookahead is used to test if the pattern is not present and case isn't then return the match of the string.
