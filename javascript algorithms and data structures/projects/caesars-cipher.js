/**
 * Caesars Cipher
 * 
 * One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher.
 * In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.
 * 
 * A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.
 * 
 * Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.
 * 
 * All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
 */

/**
 * Convert a ROT13 encoded string to a decoded string.
 * ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet.
 * 
 * @param {string} str The ROT13 encoded string.
 * @returns {string} The decoded string.
