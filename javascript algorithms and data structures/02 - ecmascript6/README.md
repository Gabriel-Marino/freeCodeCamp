## ECMAScript or ES is the standardized version of JavaScript. All modern browsers follow the ECMAScript standard. JS and ES are interchangable. Almost everything in the basic module is from ES5 which was finalized in 2009. ES6 was released in 2015 and come with many powerful features. ES5 still works, but ES6 is more modern.

```JavaScript
/**
 * Again, this is a comment.
 * And it can be multiline.
 * Or it can be singleline using //.
 * The var problemn is that var defines a variable globally, while let defines a variable locally. And this can lead to errors.
 */

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    console.log(i);
}               // This will print 0 to 9.
console.log(i); // This will print 10.
/**
 * This happen because var being global, it can be accessed outside the for loop. And the loop only printed while the condition was true,
 * but after that the i was incremented and this value could be accessed.
 * to avoid this, use let.
 */

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    console.log(i);
}               // This will print 0 to 9.
console.log(i); // This will print undefined. Because i is only defined inside the for loop.

/**
 * About the const:
 * const declare a constant, but arrays, objects, and functions still can be mutated. const only prevents reassignment of the identifier.
 * To prevent reassignment, you can use Object.freeze() to freeze the object.
 */

const NUMS = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
NUMS.push(6);                   // This will work.

Object.freeze(NUMS);            // This will freeze the array.
NUMS[0] = 30;                   // This will throw an error.

/**
 * When you need a function which will be passed to another function or which will be not used again, you can use the function expression.
 * A function expression can be defined anonymously or using arrow function.
 * If the function can be written in a single line, you can discard the curly braces.

/**
 * Rest parameters, in order to create more flexible functions, ES6 introduced the rest parameter.
 * Which is ... follow by the name of the parameter. Thiw parametes will work like an array.
 * So is possible to pass as many parameters as you want. And in the function treat them as elements of an array.

    // the first argument is args[0], the second is args[1], etc.
    // function body

const sum = (...args) => args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

/**
 * Spread operator, introduced in the ES6, is used to spread an array into a function.
 * When a function expect multiple arguments, you can use the spread operator to pass an array as a single argument.
 * The spread operator is ... followed by the name of the array.
 */

const NUMBERS = [7, 69, 42, -1, 42069, -42069, 2, 27, 72];
const MAX = Math.max(...NUMBERS);   // This will return 42069. The spread operator spreads the array into a single argument.
let arr = [...NUMBERS];             // The spread operator return an unpacked array. He only work in an argument to a function or in an array liteal.
let spread = [..NUMBERS]            // This will throw an error.

/**
 * Destructuring, introduced in the ES6, is used to extract data from an object.
 * Is possible to assign the values to variables with the same name as the properties of the object, or to new variables.
 * To assign to new variables, you write the property name followed by a colon and the new variable name.
 * Is possible to use destructuring with nested objects.
 * Is possible to use destructuring with arrays. Different from the spread operator, you can choose what values to extract and can to assign to variables.
 * While spread will return a list or unpacked array, the destructuring will return the value from the exact position.
 * And you can use any number of commas to select the values you want.
 * Is possible to combine destructuring with the rest operator, so while some elements are assign to variables the rest will be returned as an array.
 * Is possible to use destructuring as parameters in functions, so you can pass an object as a parameter and extract the values you need.

 * Or to use export {} with the names of the variables or functions to export.
 * And to import the module is necessary to use the keyword import at the file where you want to use the module, but indicating where the module is.
 * import { name } from 'module.js'; or import * as alias from 'module.js' to import all the variables or functions of the module.
 * As fallback precaucion is recommended to use the export default. export default only work with functions.
 * To import the export default is only need to call import name from 'module.js'; without the curly brackets.

/**

 * A promise is always declared with the parameters resolve and reject, they're methods to determine the outcome of the promise.
 * Asyncronous operations are the one which not follow a order of execution. Usually they're executed in parallel and originate from requests out of the place where the code is executed.
 * if the promise is resolved is used the method then to handle the outcome of the promise. Otherwise is used the catch method.
